## Ecosystem

The [BayatGames][bayatgames] organization consists of several distinct projects focused on the gaming and game development industry.

## Contributions

There are multiple ways to contribute beyond just writing code.

### Improve documentation

As a user of this project, you are ideally positioned to help us improve our documentation. This could include correcting typos, fixing errors, providing better explanations, adding new examples, or clarifying complex information.

### Improve issues

Some issues lack sufficient information, are not easily reproducible, or contain incorrect details. Your help in improving these issues makes them easier to resolve.

### Give feedback on issues

We value diverse perspectives and opinions in discussions on our issue tracker.

### Write code

Code contributions are highly valued. Before creating a pull request, it's often beneficial to first create an issue that reports a bug or suggests a new feature. This helps prevent unnecessary work and ensures alignment with project goals.

## Development Workflow

Our development process follows the [Bayat Development Conventions](https://github.com/BayatGames/conventions). Below is an outline of key workflow elements.

### Branching Strategy

We follow the [Git Flow](https://github.com/BayatGames/conventions/blob/main/docs/git/flow.md) branching strategy:

1. Create a new branch from `main` for each feature, fix, or improvement
2. Name your branch with a descriptive prefix:
   * `feature/` for new features
   * `fix/` for bug fixes
   * `docs/` for documentation changes
   * `refactor/` for code refactoring
   * `test/` for changes to tests
   * `chore/` for maintenance tasks

Example: `feature/add-new-component` or `fix/resolve-memory-leak`

### Commit Guidelines

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification as outlined in our [Commit Conventions](https://github.com/BayatGames/conventions/blob/main/docs/git/commits.md):

```plaintext
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

Types include: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore, etc.

Examples:

```plaintext
feat(ui): add button component
fix(api): resolve authentication issue
docs(readme): update installation instructions
```

### Pull Request Process

1. Ensure your branch is up to date with the latest changes from `main`
2. Update documentation as necessary
3. Add tests for new features
4. Run all tests locally before submitting
5. Complete the PR template thoroughly
6. Request reviews from maintainers
7. Address review feedback promptly

## Coding Standards

All contributions must adhere to our comprehensive [Bayat Development Conventions](https://github.com/BayatGames/conventions), which include:

* Language-specific standards and patterns
* Documentation requirements
* Testing expectations
* Accessibility considerations
* Security best practices

For specific guidance, refer to the relevant sections in our [conventions repository](https://github.com/BayatGames/conventions).

## Submitting an issue

* The issue tracker is for issues.
    See [`SUPPORT.md`][support] for how to get help.
* Search the issue tracker (including closed issues) before opening a new
    issue
* Ensure you're using the latest version of projects
* Use a clear and descriptive title
* Include as much information as possible: steps to reproduce the issue,
    error message, version, operating system, etc.
* The more detailed your issue report, the more effectively we can address it
* The best issue report includes a failing test or demo that demonstrates the problem

## Submitting a pull request

* For significant changes, it's best to discuss your approach in an issue first to prevent unnecessary work
* For ambitious tasks, share your work with the community early to gather feedback
* New features should include tests and documentation
* Limit your pull request to a single focused change
* Test your changes thoroughly before submission
