### Asking quality questions

Effective questions lead to effective answers. When formulating your question:

*   Be specific about what you need help with:
    *   Describe what you're trying to accomplish
    *   Explain the problem you're encountering and what steps you've taken to resolve it
    *   Identify any concepts that are unclear to you
*   Consider using the [rubber duck debugging method][rubberduck] to clarify your thinking
*   Be aware of the [XY problem][xy] (asking about your attempted solution rather than your actual problem)
*   Check if a similar question has already been asked on GitHub
*   When possible, provide sample code, a [.NET Fiddle][dotnetfiddle], [Repl.it][replit], or a video demonstration
*   The more detailed and well-structured your question, the better we can assist you
